## Technologies and skills used 

+ HTML
+ CSS


## Reason for creation
To build a simple website for a faux portfolio for the Treehouse Techdegree FEWD program.

## What I did

Per the instructions I built a faux portfolio that included a header, a footer and some body content. The design was left to our discretion.
 
## Backstory

This is the first project for the Techdegree FEWD program. It was super stinkin' easy. By the time I started the program I was already tinkering with Vue.js. I spent more time on this project than was probably necessary but I had a lot of fun with it. It has a light and airy feel that makes me happy.

It does have an odd quirk upon loading. The page loads with a resizing transition. In retrospect I don't know why I never changed that.
